        Vector Databases and Embeddings:
        Vector databases store high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and enable efficient
        similarity search. They are essential for RAG systems and semantic search.
        
        How Embeddings Work:
        - Text is converted to numerical vectors
        - Similar meanings have similar vectors
        - Vector distance measures semantic similarity
        
        Common Embedding Models:
        - OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
        - Sentence Transformers (open source)
        - Cohere embeddings
        - Google Universal Sentence Encoder
        
        Vector Search:
        - Cosine similarity
        - Euclidean distance
        - Dot product
