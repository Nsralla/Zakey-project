        LangChain Framework:
        LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides
        tools and abstractions to make it easier to build LLM-powered applications.
        
        Core Components:
        1. Prompts: Templates and management for LLM inputs
        2. Models: Interface to various LLM providers
        3. Chains: Combining multiple LLM calls in sequence
        4. Agents: Dynamic decision-making based on observations
        5. Memory: Maintaining state across interactions
        6. Indexes: Document processing and retrieval
        
        Common Patterns:
        - Question answering over documents
        - Chatbots with memory
        - API interactions
        - Data analysis and summarization
