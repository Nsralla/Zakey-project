        Model Context Protocol (MCP):
        MCP is a protocol for connecting AI applications with external data sources and tools.
        It provides a standardized way for AI systems to interact with various services.
        
        Key Concepts:
        - Server: Exposes tools and resources
        - Client: Consumes tools from servers
        - Transport: Communication layer (stdio, HTTP)
        - Tools: Functions that agents can call
        - Resources: Data that can be accessed
        
        Benefits:
        - Standardized integration
        - Reusable components
        - Security and access control
        - Easy scaling
        
        Use Cases:
        - Connecting agents to databases
        - API integrations
        - File system access
        - External service integration
