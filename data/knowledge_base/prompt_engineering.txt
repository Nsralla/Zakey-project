        Prompt Engineering Best Practices:
        Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting good results from language models.
        
        Key Principles:
        1. Be specific and clear in instructions
        2. Provide context and examples
        3. Use role-playing and personas
        4. Break complex tasks into steps
        5. Specify output format
        6. Include constraints and requirements
        
        Prompt Patterns:
        - Few-shot learning: Provide examples
        - Chain-of-thought: Ask for step-by-step reasoning
        - Role prompting: Assign an expert role
        - Template-based: Use structured formats
        
        Common Mistakes:
        - Vague or ambiguous instructions
        - Insufficient context
        - Conflicting requirements
        - Not specifying output format
