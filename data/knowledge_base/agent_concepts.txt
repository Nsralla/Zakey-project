        AI Agents and Autonomous Systems:
        An AI agent is a system that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes
        actions to achieve specific goals. Modern AI agents use large language models as their
        reasoning engine.
        
        Agent Components:
        - Perception: Understanding input and context
        - Reasoning: Using LLMs to make decisions
        - Action: Executing tasks using tools
        - Memory: Retaining information across interactions
        
        Agent Types:
        1. Reactive Agents: Respond to immediate stimuli
        2. Deliberative Agents: Plan and reason about actions
        3. Hybrid Agents: Combine reactive and deliberative approaches
        4. Multi-Agent Systems: Multiple agents collaborating
        
        Tools for Agents:
        - Search APIs (web, database)
        - Code execution
        - File operations
        - API integrations
        - Calculator and math operations
